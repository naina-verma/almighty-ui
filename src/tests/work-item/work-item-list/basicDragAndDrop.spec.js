Drag and drop testing is blocked. The behavior seen is:

* On PhantomJS - The test fails - it's not possible to determine where the failure occurs.
* On Chrome - The test fails - visual observation shows that the drag and drop operation is not performed.
* On Firefox - The test fails - The mouseDown operation seems to function, but the location used 
  cannot be changed from that defined by the physical location of the browser on the system on which
  the test is run. The mouseMove and mouseUp operations are not performed. If the test is run in a 
  headless mode with Xvfb, the same problems are seen.

  Multiple other people/groups are encountering related issues. Multiple workarounds have been
  published, buit these workaround have not been seen to be successful for us.
